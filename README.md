# Data Analysis and Computational Physics Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of data analysis and computational physics projects. This repository showcases my skills in statistical analysis, simulation techniques, parameter estimation, and processing of large scientific datasets.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:

### [Computational Modeling and Analysis](./computational_modeling/)

This section contains projects focused on statistical methods, hypothesis testing, and parameter estimation:

- **Hypothesis Testing Simulation**: Implementation of sampling techniques and analysis of statistical error rates
- **Statistical Distance Analysis**: Maximum likelihood estimation and uncertainty quantification between random points
- **Parameter Estimation**: Complete workflow for model fitting with statistical validation
- **Random Variable Simulation**: Exploration of probability distributions and the Central Limit Theorem

### [Atmospheric Science](./atmospheric_science/)

This section demonstrates advanced analysis of large scientific datasets:

- **Exoplanet Atmospheric Analysis**: Comprehensive characterization of atmospheric composition, thermal structure, and radiative properties using multi-probe measurements

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
- Monte Carlo simulation techniques
- Parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification
- Processing and visualization of large scientific datasets
- Implementation of physical models from first principles
- Application of thermodynamics and radiative transfer principles

Each project includes detailed documentation, visualization of results, and thorough explanation of the methods employed. Feel free to explore each directory for more specific information about individual projects.
