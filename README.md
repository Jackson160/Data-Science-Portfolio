# Data Analysis and Computational Physics Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of data analysis and computational physics projects. This repository showcases my skills in statistical analysis, simulation techniques, parameter estimation, and processing of large scientific datasets across multiple domains of physics and astronomy.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main directories:

### [Astrophysics](./Astrophysics/)
This section features analysis of astronomical survey data and dark matter research:
- **Galaxy Cluster Dark Matter Analysis**: Estimation of virial mass and mass-to-light ratios for galaxy cluster ACO 2670 using SDSS data, providing evidence for dark matter dominance through computational techniques applied to large-scale cosmic structures

### [Computational Modeling and Analysis](./Computational%20Modeling%20and%20Analysis/)
This section contains projects focused on statistical methods, hypothesis testing, and parameter estimation:
- **Hypothesis Testing Simulation**: Implementation of sampling techniques and analysis of statistical error rates
