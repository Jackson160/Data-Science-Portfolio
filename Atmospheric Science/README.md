## Exoplanet Atmospheric Analysis

This project demonstrates thorough data analysis of atmospheric probe measurements from an exoplanet mission. The code processes and analyzes multi-probe atmospheric data to characterize the planet's atmospheric composition, thermal structure, and radiative properties.

### Key Features:
- Processing of large multi-parameter atmospheric datasets from five separate atmospheric probes
- Calculation of atmospheric composition including molecular species densities and mixing ratios
- Determination of thermodynamic properties including temperature profiles and specific heat capacity
- Computation of water vapor content and relative humidity across the atmosphere
- Analysis of radiative transfer properties through optical depth calculations for different molecular species
- Detailed visualization of atmospheric parameters with pressure-based profiles
- Hydrostatic equilibrium analysis through pressure gradient relationships

This project showcases techniques for handling large scientific datasets, implementing atmospheric physics calculations, and deriving meaningful atmospheric properties from raw measurements. The analysis combines principles from thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and radiative transfer to provide a comprehensive characterization of an exoplanet's atmosphere using multi-probe data.
